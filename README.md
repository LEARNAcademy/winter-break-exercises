# Winter Break Exercises
As Bryan mentioned, after the winter break, you'll likely have your first experience with stepping away from coding long enough to feel a little disoriented when you come back to it.  Keep in mind that it's important to strike the balance between going cold turkey on coding and burning out from self-prescribed three-day hackathons.
Goal: Do about 40 hours of coding over the course of two weeks in an evenly distributed manner. Avoid ten hours of code in four days!

## Refactor and Beautify a React Project
Estimated amount of time: 5-âˆž hours
Here's your chance to revisit those Javascript/React projects, complete them and make them things you want to showcase. Explore styling them and consider refactoring code to be more performant and/or more legible. (Remember: Those commits are also showcase-worthy!)

# Show and Tell
Prepare a three minute show and tell for the cohort.
Pick one or two of the following topics to help structure your presentation.

#### Topics

 - Talk about errors you encountered in your assessments, Wildlife
   Tracker App, or whatever project you're working on. Show the error
   message. Discuss your solution. Where/how did you find it? What did
   you learn?
 - Talk about comments that you left on your code reviews. Why did you
   feel these comments were important? What was your experience in
   providing feedback?
 - Talk about new vocabulary word(s) you learned/relearned and
   encountered while working on projects.  These can be words you are
   familiar with in layman's terms but is used differently in the
   software/web development context or words that are completely new to you.
 - Talk about refactoring you did. Show your commits. Why were these
   changes important? What problem(s) were you trying you solve?
