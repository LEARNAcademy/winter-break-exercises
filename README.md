# Winter Break Exercises
As Bryan mentioned, after the winter break, you'll likely have your first experience with stepping away from coding long enough to feel a little disoriented when you come back to it.  Keep in mind that it's important to strike the balance between going cold turkey on coding and burning out from self-prescribed three-day hackathons.

Goal: Do about 40 hours of coding over the course of the next weeks in an evenly distributed manner. Avoid ten hours of code in four days!

## Refactor and Beautify a Javascript/React Project
Estimated amount of time: 10 - 15 hours

Here's your chance to revisit those Javascript/React projects (Tic-Tac-Toe and Dice Roller Challenge), complete them and make them things you want to showcase in your portfolio. Explore styling them and consider refactoring code to be more performant and/or more legible. 

Remember: Those refactoring commits are also showcase-worthy in interviews too!

# Show and Tell
Estimated amount of time: 2-3 hours (for preparation)

Prepare a **three-minute** show and tell for the cohort.
Pick one or two of the following topics to help structure your presentation.

#### Topics

 - Talk about errors you encountered in your assessments, Wildlife
   Tracker App, or whatever project you're working on. Show the error
   message. Discuss your solution. Where/how did you find it? What did
   you learn?
 - Talk about comments that you left on your code reviews. Why did you
   feel these comments were important? What was your experience in
   providing feedback?
 - Talk about new vocabulary word(s) you learned/relearned and
   encountered while working on projects.  These can be words you are
   familiar with in layman's terms but are used differently in the
   software/web development context or words that are completely new to you.
 - Talk about refactoring you did. Show your commits. Why were these
   changes important? What problem(s) were you trying you solve?
   
# Code Review

Building your code reviewer muscle as a web developer. Know that your input, at any level, is valuable. Code reviewing gives you the opportunity to read code and understand all the things that go into making code beautiful.
Each person will do two code reviews (one code review on a section of the Week 6 Assessments and one code review on the Wildlife Tracker Challenge).
Be mindful to promptly pushing your code for assignments because **your peers will need time to read your code and provide feedback by the end of the break.**
Below are your code review assignments.

## Code Review Code of Conduct
- LEARN Code of Conduct
- [Optional Reading: Code Review Code of Conduct](https://medium.com/front-end-weekly/code-reviews-code-of-conduct-6c78a026ed35)
- Goal: Provide feedback that may help the author's code be more legible and performant, easy to read, and uses best practices. If the code is outstanding, leave comments that indicate what you appreciated about it.
- Be respectful. Code is personal because people have worked very hard on it, exercise humbleness in your feedback. Be suggestive, not decisive.
- **General expectation of minimum three comments on each Github pull request.**

### Code Review Checklist
Consider improvements that can be made to: 
- Variable naming: Are they descriptive and accurate? If not, what is an example of a fitting name? Does it help with understanding the code?
- Formatting: Is it helping or hurting your ability to understand the code quickly?
- Comments: Are they helpful and accurate? 
- Logic: Is there another way to achieve the same behavior? What are the pros and cons of doing it that way?
- Compliments: What does the code do well?
